# /cn:resume-score

Scores any resume against a job description. Use this to evaluate a resume you've written yourself, a version from a previous employer, or an artifact generated by Career Navigator. Honest scores only — no inflation.

## Usage

```
/cn:resume-score
/cn:resume-score [resume file path]
```

## Workflow

### 1. Get the resume and JD

If not provided, ask:

> "Please share:
> 1. The resume you want to score (paste content or provide a file path)
> 2. The job description you're targeting (paste the full text)"

Both are required for a meaningful score. A score without a target JD is generic and less useful.

### 2. Invoke resume-coach agent

Hand off to the **resume-coach** agent, which applies the **ats-optimization** skill and scores on three dimensions.

### 3. Output the full scoring report

```
RESUME SCORE REPORT
════════════════════════════════════════════
Target role: [Title] at [Company]
Scored:      [timestamp]

DIMENSION 1 — ATS KEYWORD MATCH
Score: [X]/40 points

Keywords matched: [list with frequency]
Keywords missing: [list — these are priority fixes]
Synonym mismatches: [e.g., "cross-team" vs. JD's "cross-functional" — use JD's language]

DIMENSION 2 — FORMATTING COMPLIANCE
Score: [X]/30 points

✓ PASS  Single-column layout
✓ PASS  No tables detected
✗ FAIL  Contact info in header — move to body [−5 pts]
✗ WARN  Font may not be ATS-safe: [font name] [−3 pts]
[... full checklist ...]

DIMENSION 3 — NARRATIVE STRENGTH
Score: [X]/30 points

Bullets with quantified results: [N] of [total]
Active voice: [X]% of bullets
Specificity: [assessment]
Narrative coherence: [assessment — does the resume tell a clear career story?]

Flagged bullets:
- "[bullet text]" — no measurable outcome; suggest: "[revised version]"
- "[bullet text]" — passive voice; suggest: "[revised version]"
[...]

────────────────────────────────────────
OVERALL SCORE: [total]/100

PRIORITIZED FIXES (highest impact first):
1. [Fix] — adds ~[N] points
2. [Fix] — adds ~[N] points
3. [Fix] — adds ~[N] points
[...]
════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 4. Offer to apply fixes

> "Would you like me to apply any of these fixes? I can:
> - Revise specific bullets
> - Restructure a section
> - Generate a revised version with all fixes applied (saves as a new artifact)"

### 5. Offer to add to corpus

If this resume contains strong bullets that aren't already in the corpus:
> "Some of the experience in this resume isn't in your corpus yet. Would you like to add it? Run /cn:add-source with this resume."

## Scoring Notes

- Scores reflect the specific JD provided. The same resume may score very differently against different JDs.
- An ATS score of 75+ is generally competitive. Below 60 means significant keyword gaps.
- Narrative strength matters for human reviewers after ATS filtering — both scores matter.
- This command does not save the scored resume as an artifact unless you explicitly ask for a revised version.
