# /cn:search-jobs

Finds job opportunities matched to your skills and targets. In Phase 1A, this uses an assisted-manual workflow: Career Navigator generates optimized search strings you paste into job boards, then ranks the results you bring back against your corpus.

> **Indeed API**: Automated job search (without copy-pasting) requires an Indeed Publisher ID. See the **Indeed API Setup** section in README.md for instructions. Once configured in `.mcp.json`, this command switches to automated mode automatically.

## Usage

```
/cn:search-jobs
/cn:search-jobs [role title] [location]
```

## Workflow

### 1. Invoke job-scout agent

Hand off to the **job-scout** agent, which will:

**Step 1 — Confirm search parameters**

The agent asks for (or reads from the conversation):
- Target role types (e.g., "Senior Product Manager", "Staff Engineer")
- Location preferences (remote / hybrid / metro area)
- Minimum salary (used for filtering and risk-flagging)
- Industries to include or exclude
- Company size preference

If the corpus exists, the agent reads `data/corpus/index.json` and infers likely role types from `skill_tags` — but confirms before proceeding.

**Step 2 — Generate search strings**

Produces 2–3 search string variations per platform (broad, targeted, non-obvious angle):

```
SEARCH STRINGS — COPY AND PASTE THESE
════════════════════════════════════════════

INDEED
Search: "senior product manager" "B2B SaaS" remote
Link:   https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=%22senior+product+manager%22+%22B2B+SaaS%22&remotejobs=1

Variation: "product manager" OR "PM" "platform" remote $130,000
Variation: "group product manager" OR "lead PM" startup remote

LINKEDIN
Search: Senior Product Manager
Filters to set: Remote ✓ | Experience: Senior | Date: Past week

Google Jobs:
Search: site:jobs.lever.co OR site:greenhouse.io "senior product manager" remote "B2B"

════════════════════════════════════════════
Paste your search results below — job titles, companies, descriptions, or URLs.
(For URLs, please paste the job description text directly; I can't fetch URLs.)
```

**Step 3 — Receive and rank results**

Waits for user to paste results. Accepts:
- Job titles and company names
- Pasted job description text
- Structured lists ("Company X — Role Y — Remote — $120–150K")

**Step 4 — Score and rank each opportunity**

For each opportunity:

```
RANKED RESULTS
════════════════════════════════════════════
#1  Senior PM — WidgetCo (Remote)           Score: 87/100
    Skills match: 9/12 corpus tags matched
    Salary: $140–165K (meets target)
    ✓ Strong fit: your B2B SaaS background matches their core need
    ⚠  Culture flag: "fast-paced" + no team size mentioned — worth asking

#2  Product Lead — StartupX (SF/Remote)     Score: 74/100
    Skills match: 7/12 corpus tags matched
    Salary: Equity-heavy, below market base
    ⚠  Risk: Series A, equity-only comp structure — verify runway before pursuing

#3  Group PM — Acme Corp (Chicago)          Score: 61/100
    Skills match: 6/12 corpus tags matched
    Location: Not remote — flag if remote required
════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Step 5 — Next step prompts**

For high-scoring roles (≥ 70):
> "Want to track any of these? Tell me which ones and I'll log them — or run /cn:track-application."

For flagged risks:
> "The equity-heavy structure at StartupX is worth a closer look. Want to discuss before deciding whether to pursue it?"

### 2. Additional search guidance

If the user wants to expand the search manually:

**Non-obvious search angles** (generated by job-scout based on corpus skill_tags):
- Adjacent titles that use the same core skills (e.g., "Program Manager", "GTM Lead" for a PM with strong GTM experience)
- Smaller companies where the role might carry more scope
- Industries where your vertical experience translates as a differentiator

**Search strategy tips surfaced by job-scout**:
- New postings on Indeed appear in the "Date: Past 24 hours" filter — check daily rather than weekly for competitive roles
- Roles posted on company career pages before job boards often have less applicant volume
- Google Jobs aggregates from all boards — a single search catches most of them

## Indeed API Setup Note

This command operates in assisted-manual mode until an Indeed Publisher ID is configured. To enable automated search:

1. Register at the Indeed Publisher Program (link in README.md)
2. Add your Publisher ID to `.mcp.json` per the setup instructions there
3. Restart Claude Cowork (or Claude Code) — automated mode activates on next session

Automated mode will fetch and rank results directly without the copy-paste step.
